The primary use of this app is to create and manage projects and it's related tasks and users. An _Admin_, who is built into the system will create _Projects_ and assign a _Project Manager (PM)_ to it. The PM will later add _Tasks_ into the project and assign each task to registered _Users_.

The three user roles in this application are:

- Admin
- Project Manager (PM)
- Employee (User)

All users registered through the /signup page has the **User** role by default. Only admin can change the user role to **PM**.
